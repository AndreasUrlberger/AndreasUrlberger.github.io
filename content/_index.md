I began programming in 2017 and pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Applied Sciences Munich from 2019 to 2023. Currently, I am studying for a Masterâ€™s degree in Robotics, Cognition, and Intelligence at the Technical University of Munich. Throughout this time, I have continuously worked on side projects and explored new technologies. Below, you can find some of the projects I have worked on.
