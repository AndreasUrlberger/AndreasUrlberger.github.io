As part of a collaborative project between business administration and computer science students at HM Hochschule München and Green City Experience (GCX), we developed SurveySolver, a software tool designed to streamline the evaluation of free-text responses in environmental surveys. These surveys, crucial for gauging public opinion on sustainable urban development, generate a significant volume of unstructured data, posing a challenge for manual analysis. SurveySolver addresses this by providing an intuitive user interface and leveraging text recognition to suggest automatic categorization of responses, thereby significantly reducing the organizational workload for GCX.

Using SurveySolver, survey responses collected via LimeSurvey can be exported as Excel files and uploaded into the tool, where they are categorized based on keywords and sorted into themes. The software also identifies supportive and opposing sentiments within the responses, ensuring no valuable feedback is overlooked. This categorized data can be easily filtered and exported into pre-designed PowerPoint templates, facilitating targeted analysis and presentation. The success of SurveySolver led GCX to consider further development and potential future collaborations, highlighting the project's impact and the innovative spirit of the DTLab and Co-Innovation Lab at Hochschule München.
