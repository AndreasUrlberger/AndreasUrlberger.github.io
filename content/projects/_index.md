An overview of some of my projects.
{{< /lead >}}

Since I started programming in school, I have always enjoyed working on side projects in my spare time. These projects sparked my initial interest in programming and motivated me to pursue a degree in computer science. Whether itâ€™s automating labor-intensive tasks, learning new technologies, or building something cool, I find joy in the creative process. My journey began with simple scripts and Android apps, progressed to game development and embedded systems, and now, I am exploring some deep learning projects.

This list is not exhaustive, I may add more projects as time permits. However, I am usually busy working on new projects. While I may not always finish every project ðŸ˜…, my passion lies in exploring technologies and building stuff.
