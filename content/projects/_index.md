An overview of some of my projects.
{{< /lead >}}

Ever since I started programming in school, I have enjoyed doing side projects whenever I have some spare time. This is what got me into programming in the first place and what motivated me to study computer science. Sometimes there are just labour-intensive tasks that I want to automate, sometimes I want to learn something new, and sometimes I just want to build something cool. It started with simple scripts and Android apps, went on to game development followed by embedded systems, and currently, I am exploring some deep learning projects.

This list is by no means exhaustive, I might add more projects later on when I find the time for it, but I'm probably already busy working on a new project. I guess finishing projects is not my strong suit ðŸ˜…, I just enjoy exploring new things and building stuff.
