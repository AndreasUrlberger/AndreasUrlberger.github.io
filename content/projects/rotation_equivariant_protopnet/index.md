As part of a practical called "Applied Deep Learning in Medicine" at the Technical University of Munich, we attempted to make the Prototypical Parts Network (ProtoPNet) rotation equivariant, aiming for more stable prediction under rotation of the input image. We are pretty much done with it, we just need to create some more visualizations and write the final paper. Then we will try to publish it in a scientific journal.

## To be continued...
More information is coming! We're wrapping up our paper and I will update this page with all the details and visuals once it is published.
