Inspired by the game Wii Play Tanks, in this game the player controls a toy tank and fights others. Each tank has special features that differentiate it from others. The main challange of this game is that bullets ricochet at walls. One of the challanges in development is the calculation of bullet trajectories for the AI. The game is playable but development is currently on hold.
