"RemindMe" is an Alexa skill, which we developed in a small group at the University of Applied Sciences Munich as a student project in collaboration with the Alzheimer Gesellschaft MÃ¼nchen e.V. Its goal is to assist Alzheimer's patients in remembering appointments and necessary items. The skill works by issuing reminders with increasing frequency as the appointment time approaches, ensuring that patients stay on track. This intuitive tool interacts with users through Amazon Alexa, making it accessible even to non-technical users and helping to restore a sense of independence and confidence. 

We were encouraged to use the AWS cloud platform to develop the skill.
